# Collaborative Data Science

> The goal of the study is to understand how data scientists remotely collaborate and communicate using Jupyter Notebook and common collaboration tools. You will join us with 2 remote sessions during this week of 2 hours each to work on a predictive modeling problem in groups of 3. 

## Timeline
<!-- Change the timeline for each group! -->
- Session 1: September 29, 8:00pm - 9:00pm, EST
- Break:  
- Session 2: October 6, 8:00pm - 9:00pm, EST

## Task Description
<!-- Change the link to overview, move other mds into /unreleased for session 0 -->
The problem description will be posted [here](overview.md) when the study starts. You should submit the following materials at the end of the study:

- A final report in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Prediction result on the test dataset

We are using a remote screensharing tool to collect data. You should walkthrough [session 0](session0.md) before the study to install the required tools.

## Tools for Communication
<!-- For groups using Slack -->
**Please only use the Slack channel for communication.** Group members should not discuss with each other about the predictive modeling problem (e.g., send emails or chat online) outside the experimental session. 

<!-- For groups using Hangouts video conferencing, add url to the conferencing -->

**Please turn on [Hangouts video conferencing]() in Chrome for communication throughout all the sessions.** Group members should not discuss with each other about the predictive modeling problem (e.g., send emails or chat online) outside the experimental session. 

## Tools for Collaboration
<!-- For groups using shared environment -->
Please use [Experimentor](https://experimentor.mentoracademy.org) for collaboratively editing Jupyter Notebooks. A detailed instruction could be find [here](howto.md). Feel free to use other tools for collaboration.
<!-- For groups using non-shared environment -->
Please use [Experimentor](https://experimentor.mentoracademy.org) for collaborating.
