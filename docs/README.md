# Collaborative Data Science

> The goal of the study is to understand how data scientists remotely collaborate and communicate using Jupyter Notebook and common collaboration tools. You will join us with 4 remote sessions during this week to work on a predictive modeling problem in groups of 3. The winner will receive up to $50 gift card for each team member. Good luck!

## Remote Screensharing
We are using [Lookback](https://lookback.io/) to collect data on your screen. You should have Chrome installed on your computer. Please test and set up the experimental environment before the first session using [this link](https://participate.lookback.io/GxCBxm).

## Tools for Communication
Please follow the instructions that we have emailed you. Groups are allowed to only use the give tools for communication. Group members should not discuss with each other about the predictive modeling problem(e.g., send emails or chat online) outside the experimental session.
