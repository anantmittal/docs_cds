# Collaborative Data Science

> The goal of the study is to understand how data scientists remotely collaborate and communicate using Jupyter Notebook and common collaboration tools. You will join us with 2 remote sessions during this week of 2 hours each to work on a predictive modeling problem in groups of 3. 

## Task Description
<!-- Change the link to overview, move other mds into /unreleased for session 0 -->
The problem description will be posted [here](overview.md) when the study starts. 

We are using a remote screensharing tool to collect data. You should walkthrough [session 0](session0.md) before the study to install the required tools.





## Tools for Communication
<!-- For groups using Slack -->
**Please use the Slack channel for communication with researchers and turn on Hangouts video conferencing in Chrome for communication with your group members throughout the sessions .** 

One of the team members can share the hangouts link with the team using slack channel. 

Group members should not discuss with each other about the predictive modeling problem (e.g., send emails or chat online) outside the experimental session. 

<!-- For groups using Hangouts video conferencing, add url to the conferencing -->
