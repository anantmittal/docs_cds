# Collaborative Data Science

> The goal of the study is to understand how data scientists remotely collaborate and communicate using Jupyter Notebook and common collaboration tools. You will join us with 4 remote sessions during this week to work on a predictive modeling problem in groups of 3. The winner will receive up to $50 gift card for each team member. Good luck!

## Timeline

- **Recruitment: September 3 - September 7**

- Session 1: September 10, 1 hour

- Session 2: September 11, 1 hour
