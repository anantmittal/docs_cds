## Setup Study Environment

- Please turn on the Lookback extension for [session3](https://participate.lookback.io/GxCBxm)

## Goal for Session 3

In this session, groups will apply the basic regression model to predict the house price. For reference, your regression algorithm should at least beat the baseline score (**TODO**).

- Groups could use the sklearn library to apply the basic linear regression model
- Groups may use cross validation to examine the performance of the model.
