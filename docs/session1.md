### Setup Study Environment

- Make sure Chrome is installed on your computer
- Please turn on the Lookback extension for [session1](https://participate.lookback.io/wFEBKK?live) and wait for the research team to join

### Goal for Session 1

In this session, your group will use concepts such as feature engineering to solve the predictive modeling problem at hand.

### Submission

Please submit your files [here](https://goo.gl/forms/GEkrwYZK6rJdHJvG3).

Please submit a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) which documents all the steps you have tried in each session, with executable codes and textual explanations of what works, what does not work. The notebook shoud be clear and instuctive enough that a novice data scientist could walk through, run the code and understand your work.


### After Session 1

- Please fill this [diary](https://umich.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3aPb6f7nmjBweeF) (roughly 5 mins to finish) for we to collect feedbacks from your collaboration experience.
