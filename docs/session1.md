## Setup Study Environment

## Goal for Session 1

In this session, groups will first explore the problem space, understand the dataset, build and test the hypothesis on what features might strongly/weakly relate to the ‘SalePrice’. 

- Groups may look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem
- Groups may apply descriptive statistics and data visualizations to understand the dependant variable - ‘Sale Price’ (e.g., deviate from the normal distribution, peakedness)
- Groups may apply descriptive statistics and data visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps, histograms) to understand about how the dependent variable and independent variables relate - some variables might be outliers
