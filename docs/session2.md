## Setup Study Environment

- Please turn on the Lookback extension for [session2](https://participate.lookback.io/sMqpJH?live)

## Goal for Session 2

In this session, groups will clean the dataset based on findings in the previous session.

- Groups may develop their own strategies to handle missing data (N/As). For example, delete a record if it has too many missing attributes; use min/max/mean/median/mod to fill numerical missing attributes
- Groups may need to normalize numerical data
- Groups may remove non-related attributes and outlier records
- Groups may encode discrete attributes to numerical values, for example, using index
