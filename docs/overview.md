## Description

Although a lot of students, working professionals, etc. join online courses but a very small percent actually complete the course. 

In this task, you are going to analyze the student's data and predict the week which they may dropout of the online course. Please use the provided data files for feature engineering. 

## Evaluation

It is your job to predict the dropout week for the student. There is no separate test set provided. You can split your data into training and test set to evaluate your model.


### Submission

Please submit your files [here](https://goo.gl/forms/GEkrwYZK6rJdHJvG3).

Please submit a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) which documents all the steps you have tried in each session, with executable codes and textual explanations of what works, what does not work. The notebook shoud be clear and instuctive enough that a novice data scientist could walk through, run the code and understand your work.
